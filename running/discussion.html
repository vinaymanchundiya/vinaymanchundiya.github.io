				<p>If I were to describe the feeling when everything came along on the computer screen in one word, then it will be - FantabulisticFantastic.
				This was an awesome experience in bringing up everything together. The most fun part was playing around with the GameObjects through scripting.
			No question on the idea of Augmentation at table top scale, this is going to be wonderful. People will get nutritional information about the things on the table top.  
			However, On the broader perspective, whatever a person is going to see,
		will be exploited for monetary benefits. For example, If a cereal product needs to be promoted, the AR glass can detect the compnays previous product.
	Once detected, the company can then augment the new product with the health benefits. For me this is like a privacy invasion. I am pretty certain that, user might have to grant special permissions to do so.
But we all know, we are still being followed on all the web pages we visit through loop holes. I hope that AR doesnt gives rise to something where only buying products will not be enough. A person will have to
subscribe so as to enjoy a advertisement free breakfast.</p>
