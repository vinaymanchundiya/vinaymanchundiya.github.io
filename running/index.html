					<h1>Description</h1>
					<p>AR BREAKFAST has been created as a part of coursework for CS 491.

					In the future, when people will be wearing AR glasses, they might get everything in an augmented manner.
					There are 3 scenes created for this application using different types of image targets.</p>
